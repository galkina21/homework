    <p>"Later !"The word, the voice, the attitude.

        I'd never heard anyone use "later" to say goodbye before. It sounded harsh, curt, and dismissive, spoken with the veiled indifference of people who may not care to see or hear from you again.
        
        It is the first thing I remember about him, and I can hear it still today. Later!
        
        I shut my eyes, say the word, and I'm back in Italy, so many years ago, walking down the tree-lined driveway, watching him step out of the cab, billowy blue shirt, wideopen collar, sunglasses, straw hat, skin everywhere. Suddenly he's shaking my hand, handing me his backpack, removing his suitcase from the trunk of the cab, asking if my father is home.
        
        It might have started right there and then: the shirt, the rolled-up sleeves, the rounded balls of his heels slipping in and out of his frayed espadrilles, eager to test the hot gravel path that led to our house, every stride already asking, Which way to the beach?
        
        This summer's houseguest. Another bore.
        
        Then, almost without thinking, and with his back already turned to the car, he waves the back of his free hand and utters a careless Later! to another passenger in the car who has probably split the fare from the station. No name added, no jest to smooth out the ruffled leave-taking, nothing. His one-word send-off: brisk, bold, and bluntedâ€”take your pick, he couldn't be bothered which.
        
        You watch, I thought, this is how he'll say goodbye to us when the time comes. With a gruff, slapdash Later!
        
        Meanwhile, we'd have to put up with him for six long weeks.</p>
